# App principles

## Target users
- Help people not familar with RAG and LLM to understand and test those patterns
- Guidance should be provided hence for begineers or average users
- Advanced users will still benefit from the feature set
- The app will help to improve Documents for RAG, prompts and LLM selection

## Architecture
- Keep always all LLM definitions in a central place llmConfig.js


## Critical rules
- Server is already started. Never run 'mpn start dev' on your own. The developement server is already started!
