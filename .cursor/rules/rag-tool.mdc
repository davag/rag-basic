# App principles

## Target users
- Help people not familar with RAG and LLM to understand and test those patterns
- Guidance should be provided hence for begineers or average users
- Advanced users will still benefit from the feature set
- The app will help to improve Documents for RAG, prompts and LLM selection

## Architecture
- Keep always all LLM definitions in a central place llmConfig.js


## Critical rules
- Server is already started. Never run 'mpn start dev' on your own. The developement server is already started!
- Be careful with Azure Open Models. Don't change names or versions without me asking
- If server is up always check eslint errors/Warning in compile from terminal

## LLM model metadata
All your LLM model metadata is defined in a single file as per your app principles - specifically in src/config/llmConfig.js. This file contains:
- All model definitions with their properties (vendor, pricing, descriptions)
- Azure-specific model deployments with their configurations
- Embedding models like text-embedding-3-small and text-embedding-3-large
- Default application settings
- API configuration for different providers
